## Installation

[`requests`]() is an external python package available in the [PyPi package repository](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) and is a common package (although there are many more) that is used to interact with APIs.

To install `requests`, run the following command to download it to your computer:

_macOS_

```shell
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_Windows_

```shell

```

> If you run the program without installing `requests` first, you may see a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'` error
